# RetinAI-ViT

Retina AI and Vision Transformer

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness among working-age adults. Early detection and treatment can significantly reduce the risk of vision loss. This project aims to automate the DR grading process using a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer model. The model classifies retinal images into five severity stages, from "No DR" to "Proliferative DR," providing a powerful tool for screening and diagnosis assistance.
